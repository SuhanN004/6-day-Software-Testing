Day 2 Activities
Hosting Our Portfolio on Render
We deployed our portfolio web application on Render by linking it with our GitHub repository. This provided us with a live URL and experience in deploying full-stack applications.

Learning the Basics of Selenium
We were introduced to Selenium, a powerful tool for browser automation. We explored how Selenium can be used to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and automate web testing.

Web Application Testing â€“ Web Shopper
We practiced writing and executing test cases on a sample web application called Web Shopper. Using Selenium, we performed automated tests to verify the functionality of various features like search, cart, and checkout.
