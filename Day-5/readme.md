Day 5 Activities
Learning Advanced Git & GitHub Concepts
We explored more advanced Git and GitHub functionalities, including:

git clone – to clone remote repositories locally

git commit – to save changes to the local repo

git push – to upload local changes to GitHub
This helped strengthen our collaborative workflow and code management practices.

Running Test Cases on Postman (Car Model)
We used Postman to run and test API endpoints built for the car prediction model. This included:

Sending GET and POST requests

Testing model input and verifying predicted outputs

Analyzing response time and structure
This reinforced our knowledge of API-based testing in a real ML deployment scenario.
