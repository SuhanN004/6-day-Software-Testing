Day 3 Activities
Exploring Selenium Further
We deepened our understanding of Selenium and performed various automation tasks using it in the Chrome browser. Some of the key tasks included:

Automating search functionality

Simulating automated typing into input fields
This helped us understand real-world browser automation and how it can be used for testing or data entry.

Hands-on with Testing Tools
We explored multiple testing tools to understand their features and use cases. One of the main tools we used was Testmo, which allowed us to:

Manage test cases

Execute tests

Track results and maintain structured documentation

Running Test Cases
We created and executed various test cases to validate the functionality of web applications. These tests helped ensure that the applications worked as expected under different scenarios.
