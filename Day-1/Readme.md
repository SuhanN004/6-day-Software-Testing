Activities Completed
This repository documents the key activities and learning modules we completed as part of our project. Here's a brief overview:

GitHub Basics
We started by learning the fundamentals of GitHub, including repository creation, version control, commits, pushing code, and collaborating via branches and pull requests.

Creating Our Own Portfolio
We designed and developed a personal portfolio website using FastAPI for the backend and Bootstrap for a responsive frontend interface. This helped us understand web development integration with modern Python frameworks.

Hosting the Portfolio on Render
After building the portfolio, we successfully deployed it using Render, a cloud platform for hosting web applications. This gave us hands-on experience in deployment and managing web services in a live environment.

Testing a Factorial Web Application
We implemented a simple factorial web app and performed functionality testing. This included testing both the backend logic and frontend inputs to ensure accurate results.

Report Preparation
Finally, we compiled a comprehensive report documenting our learnings, project implementation, code structure, and future improvements.
