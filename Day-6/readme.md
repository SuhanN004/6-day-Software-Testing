Day 6 Activities
Revising Git Commands
We revised essential Git commands such as clone, pull, push, branch, and merge. This helped reinforce our understanding of version control and team collaboration using Git and GitHub.

Managing Virtual Environments
We created and managed multiple virtual environments to ensure isolated and dependency-free development for our Python projects. Tools like venv and pip were used for environment setup and package management.

Building a Machine Learning Model
We built a machine learning model to perform Twitter sentiment analysis. The model was trained to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Algorithms Used: Linear Regression & Random Forest
Our model leveraged two algorithms:

Linear Regression: As a baseline model.

Random Forest: For improved accuracy and better handling of classification.

We trained and tested the model using preprocessed tweet data.

Deployment & Training on Google Cloud
The training and evaluation of our model were carried out using Google Cloud, giving us exposure to cloud-based ML workflows and resource management.
