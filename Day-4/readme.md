Day 4 Activities
Using Selenium in a Virtual System
We attempted to run Selenium scripts on a virtual environment, which helped us understand the setup and challenges of browser automation in non-local systems.

Advanced Selenium Automation
We continued practicing various Selenium functionalities on Chrome, automating tasks such as:

Form filling

Button clicking

Navigation across pages
This improved our understanding of DOM interaction and real-time automation.

API Testing with Postman
We used Postman to test API endpoints by sending requests and validating responses. This introduced us to automated API testing and how it supports backend verification.

Learning GET and POST Requests
We specifically focused on understanding GET and POST requests using Postman:

GET requests for retrieving data

POST requests for sending data to the server
This gave us hands-on experience with RESTful APIs and how client-server communication works.
